                        In addition to a student dressed up as a tiger, 
                        LSU has a real, live tiger as its mascot. 
                        The fifth in a line of live tiger mascots, Mike VI 
                        (pre-pope name: Roscoe) lives on campus in a $3 million, 
                        15,000-square foot habitat with a waterfall, a stream and a pond. 
                        You can see him in it on his online Tigercam. 
                        If he feels like going into his cage before a game, 
                        he gets paraded around the field with cheerleaders on top of it. 
                        Then he’s parked outside the opposing team’s locker room so 
                        they have to walk by him before coming out to the field. 
                        LSU has a very successful football team.
