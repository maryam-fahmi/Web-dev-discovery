# Web-dev-discovery
This repository shows different websites (hosted by Toronto Metropolotin University's moon servers) that I've worked on. Due to wanting to understand the languages and all their options, I have not worked on perfecting front end designs, but rather utelizing languages such as Perl, Ruby and SQL with a lot of their functionality. Each Folder is named with the languages used in that specific website, and has it's own Description.txt that describes the purpose of the website.
